(** Create [Let] binding(s) around a given body.  (The type of this function
    prevents it from being used to create "let symbol" bindings; use the
    other functions in this module instead.)  Bindings will be elided if they
    are unused.

    free names of the [body]. *)

(** Create the "let symbol" binding(s) around a given body necessary to define
    the given lifted constant.  Two optimisations are performed:
    1. Best efforts are made not to create the binding(s) if it/they
       would be redundant.
    2. Closure variables are removed if they are not used according to the
       given [uacc].  (Such [uacc] must have seen all uses in the whole
       compilation unit.)
